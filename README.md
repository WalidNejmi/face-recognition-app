# Real-Time Face Recognition App

## Overview

This project is a cutting-edge real-time face recognition application that combines the power of OpenCV for backend processing with a modern Next.js frontend. The system achieves an impressive 98.8% accuracy in face recognition, making it suitable for various real-world applications.

## Key Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- User-friendly web interface
- Face capture and model training capabilities
- High accuracy (98.8%) using LBPH Face Recognizer
- Scalable architecture with separate frontend and backend

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Python)

The backend is built using Python and leverages the power of OpenCV for face detection and recognition. Key components include:

1. **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifier for efficient face detection in real-time video streams.
2. **Face Recognition**: Implements the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) Face Recognizer.
3. **Model Training**: Custom implementation of model training for easy addition of new faces.
4. **API Endpoints**: Flask-based RESTful API for handling requests from the frontend.

Key backend files:
- `face_recognizer.py`: Core logic for face recognition
- `face_taker.py`: Handles capturing and saving face images
- `face_train.py`: Implements model training
- `app.py`: Flask application with API endpoints



### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built using Next.js, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. Features include:

- Real-time video feed display
- Face capture functionality
- Model training interface
- Face recognition results display


### Integration

The frontend and backend are integrated using RESTful API calls.
